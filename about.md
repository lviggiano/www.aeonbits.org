Hi! 

I'm Luigi, I born in 1977 and I work as software developer since 1998. I have strong experience on the Java ecosystem.

If you are looking for my cv, you can find it [here](../docs/luigi_viggiano.pdf). References available upon request.

In 2000 I and my friend [Bruno Bossola](https://bbossola.wordpress.com/) founded the first local Java User Group in Italy, 
and it's still alive today: [JUG Torino](http://www.jugtorino.it).

I worked in several industries:
- Financial
- Telecommunications
- Software engineering and consultancy
- Public Administration

Some of the companies I worked with:
- Sun Microsystems
- Hewlett Packard
- Vodafone Global
- Telecom Italia
- Fastweb
- UBS Bank
- Banca Sella
- Intesa San Paolo Bank
- CSI Piemonte

I am passionate about so many things, some of them:
- New technologies
- [Photography](http://luigiviggiano.photography) 
- Movies, music, books
- Traveling with good company

I used to practice boxe, but I stopped some time ago.  
I also used to have a technical blog (www.newinstance.it) but it exploded when I had issues with my 
hosting provider, I still have the backup, maybe one day I'll port all the contents from Wordpress to this site. 
Or maybe not :-)

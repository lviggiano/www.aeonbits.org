One month ago, I had my first public talk about Bitcoin at the Java User Group Torino. 

It was a long time since my last presentation in front of a technical audience, and my feeling was I didn't do very 
well.

Mostly I identified some errors:

 - When you speak in front of an audience you need to know VERY WELL your slides: you never have to need to 
   read/translate them. Possibly you don't even need to have more than a look.  
   This also help in confidence in what you are doing. So: more preparation and traning in public speaking would help 
   me. And practice.  
 - I completely underestimated the amount of information in the slides compared to the available time. I tought that I 
   could explain what/why/how bitcoin, in a couple of hours, especially the technical overview, takes at least 4 hours 
   to have a complete overview.
 - I didn't do a great job conducting the discussion. My idea, to have an open discussion, with free question "anytime"
   didn't help to keep a track in the development of the discussion. Something that could help would be to allow free
   questions, but sticking to a "plan": an answer like "this will be discussed in detail later, so keep this question 
   for that time", would have probably helped. I probably need to learn more on how this problem could be faced in the 
   best way. On the other side, I don't like presentations "in one only direction" with the questions at the end: 
   personal taste. 
   
By the way, people from the audience allowed to have a video record of the talk. It's in Italian.

After the meeting, I was a bit disappointed with myself. But having seen the video yesterday, I realized that was not 
so bad after all. I kind of liked it, actually.

The slides, are available here: [bitcoin.aeonbits.org](https://bitcoin.aeonbits.org). 
I shared the [source code](https://github.com/lviggiano/bitcoin-intro-slides) for the slides, so eventually if someone
wants to use, adapt or improve them, is more than welcome. 

I am available to any organization or company, to bring what I learned about crypto and bitcoin everywhere with a talk 
like this, free of charge (except for the travel expenses).

I think that this technology is really promising and I hope that talking about this can bring a new dimension in my 
technical career, meet new people, and contribute rethinking the world.

If you want to host a bitcoin talk in Italian or English, and you are just willing to cover travel expenses, I am available.

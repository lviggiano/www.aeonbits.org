One month ago, I had my first public talk about bitcoin at the Java User Group Torino. 

It was a long time since my last presentation in front of a technical audience, and my feeling was I didn't do very 
good.

Mostly I identified some errors:

 - When you speak in front of an audience you need to know VERY WELL your slide: you never have to need to 
   read/translate them.  
   This also help in confidence in what you are doing. So: more preparation and traning in public speaking would help 
   me.  
 - I completely underestimated the amount of information in the slides compared to the available time. I tought that I 
   could explain what/why/how bitcoin, in a couple of hours, especially the technical overview, takes at least 4 hours 
   to have a complete overview discussion.
 - I didn't do a great job conducting the discussion. My idea to have an open discussion, with free question "anytime"
   didn't help to keep a track in the development of the discussion. Something that could help would be to allow free
   questions, but sticking to a "plan": an answer like "this will be discussed in detail later, so keep this question 
   for that time", would have probably helped. Another option would be to have the questions collected on a board
   and being replied at the proper time. I probably need to learn more on how this problem could be faced in the best 
   way. 
   
By the way, people from the audience allowed to have a video record of the talk. It's in Italian.

After the meeting, I was a bit disappointed with myself, and my feeling was that it was not such a bad luck that the 
guys from the jug that usually take care of video recording the meetings were bot missing that day, since I could be
embarrassed by my performance. But having seen the video yesterday, I realized that was not so bad after all. I kind of 
liked it, actually.

The slides, are available here: [bitcoin.aeonbits.org](bitcoin.aeonbits.org). 
I shared the [source code](https://github.com/lviggiano/bitcoin-intro-slides) for the slides, so eventually if someone
wants to use, adapt or improve them, is more than welcome. 

I am available to any organization or company, to bring what I learned about crypto and bitcoin everywhere, free of charge.

I think that this technology is really promising and I hope that talking about this can bring a new dimension in my 
technical career.
